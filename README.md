# nanosynth
A Testbed Software Synthesizer plugin project built live on-stream.

**Episode 56**

Set up the base project using RackAFX6, and begin to work on the project by logging MIDI messages received by the plugin.

**Episode 57**

Building pitched oscillator and low-frequency (control/modulation) oscillator classes, both of which generate a variety of waveforms. We also prototype the GUI in RackAFX.

**Episode 59**

In this show, we complete the oscillator classes, and test the results in RackAFX, using the scope and spectrum analyser that are built into the tool.
